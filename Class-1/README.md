### find The `who` command in Unix-like systems is used to display a list of users currently logged into the system.

Running the command will show something like this:

```bash
user1   tty7         2024-10-03 09:15 (:0)
user2   pts/1        2024-10-03 10:30 (192.168.1.5)
```

Hereâ€™s what each column represents:
1. **Username**: The name of the logged-in user.
2. **Terminal**: The terminal (tty or pts) the user is using.
3. **Login Time**: The time when the user logged in.
4. **Remote Host**: If the user is logged in remotely, it shows the remote IP or hostname.

It helps system administrators see who is logged into the machine. Let me know if you'd like further details!
